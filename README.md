Asynchronous Python client for Python Firefly III.

## About

This is an asynchronous Python client for the [Firefly III API](https://docs.firefly.io/api-docs/). It is designed to be used with the [Firefly III](https://www.firefly.io/) container management tool.
This package is a wrapper around the Firefly III API, which allows you to interact with Firefly III programmatically.

In it's current stage it's still in development and not all endpoints are implemented yet.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pyfirefly
```

### Example

```python
import asyncio

from pyfirefly import Firefly


async def main() -> None:
    """Run the example."""
    async with Firefly(
        api_url="http://localhost:9000",
        api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    ) as firefly:
        about = await firefly.get_about()
        print("Firefly information:", about)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

More examples can be found in the [examples folder](./examples/).

## Contributing

This is an active open-source project. We are always open to people who want to
use the code or contribute to it.

We've set up a separate document for our
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thank you for being involved! :heart_eyes:

## Setting up development environment

The simplest way to begin is by utilizing the [Dev Container][devcontainer]
feature of Visual Studio Code or by opening a CodeSpace directly on GitHub.
By clicking the button below you immediately start a Dev Container in Visual Studio Code.

This Python project relies on [Poetry][poetry] as its dependency manager,
providing comprehensive management and control over project dependencies.

You need at least:

- Python 3.11+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]

### Installation

Install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
poetry install
```

_Poetry creates by default an virtual environment where it installs all
necessary pip packages_.

### Pre-commit

This repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. To setup the pre-commit check, run:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

And to run all checks and tests manually, use the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Testing

It uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) as the test framework. To run the tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```

To update the [syrupy](https://github.com/tophat/syrupy) snapshot tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest --snapshot-update
```
